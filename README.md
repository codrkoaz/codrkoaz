### Hi there! <img src="https://github.com/codrkoaz/codrkoaz/assets/51058620/ed8f18e4-d101-4f80-9974-945efb77aade" width=40>


I'm <a href="https://link-in-bio-11k3.vercel.app/">Joza</a>, a Digital Craftsman from Grand Rapids, Michigan.

I'm primarily interested in web development and currently work as a designer at @unfinishedlegacy.

Outside of work, I'm interested in 3D Modeling, Motion Gaphics and creating clothes. I also play a lot of video games and starting to get comfortable on camera for my Youtube channel.
