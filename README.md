Hi there! ![eyes](https://github.com/codrkoaz/codrkoaz/assets/51058620/ed8f18e4-d101-4f80-9974-945efb77aade {width=40px height=40px})

I'm Joza, a Digital Craftsman from Grand Rapids, Michigan.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a software engineer at @Amazon.

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have 100M+ installs. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the 3D Modeling and creating clothes. I also play a lot of video games and make starting to get comfortable on camera on Youtube.
